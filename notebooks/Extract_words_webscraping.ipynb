      "would have been, among other things, a book of sights and sounds. A\n",

      "Atlantic changes which broke the Atlantic monotony of that voyage from\n",
      "Cadiz to Buenos Ayres. When Martin and Candide were sailing the length\n",
      "of the Mediterranean we should have had a contrast between naked scarped\n",
      "Balearic cliffs and headlands of Calabria in their mists. We should have\n",
      "had quarter distances, far horizons, the altering silhouettes of an\n",

      "closely, feel his destructive way about it with a more learned and\n",
